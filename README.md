# NodePetition (embedPetition?

You want to engage your members and ask them to take an online action? 

## Embeded in your existing website

Introducing a new tool is often a source of frustration for the users (new login, new interface to learn, new workflow, new bugs) and extra work for the IT team (adapt the layout). 
There are as well the issue of introducing a new domain/subdomain (weak SEO, potential confusion for your supporters).

Our solution? This petition tool is as transparent as possible and embed the action into one (or several) of your existing pages).
